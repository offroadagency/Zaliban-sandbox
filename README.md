# Zaliban Sandbox Repository

Welcome to the Zaliban Sandbox Repository! This is a demo version of the game [Zaliban](https://www.zaliban.com/) that is exclusively available to the owners of its corresponding NFTs. 

## Description

Zaliban is a game that takes place in a fantasy world where players can explore, battle monsters and interact with other players. This sandbox version is a demo that allows NFT owners to experience the game by controlling the characters they own.

The sandbox version is currently being developed in Unity, and it provides a basic demo of the characters owned by the NFT owners. The aim is to keep updating the sandbox version by adding more features and functionalities that will ultimately be included in the main game.
